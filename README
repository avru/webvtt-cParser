This is a WebVTT C Parser. This is a work in process.
The code is based on rillian's parser(https://github.com/rillian/webvtt).
State structure is inspired by WebKit C++ implementation of the parser
(https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/Source/WebCore/html/track).
Currently this thing is full of bugs and totally incomplete.
The least thing it can do right now is parsing the sample.vtt file provided.

Run with:
<executive name> sample.vtt
